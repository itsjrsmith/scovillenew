								<h2>Established in 2017</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Hello! My name is Tyler and I started Scoville Pool Services when I was 25 years old. I had been working in the pool industry for 2 years gaining knowledge and learning the ins and outs of pool cleanliness and equipment. With the support and encouragement from my wife Lauren, I decided to start my own business. Since then, I have been growing my business and continuing to expand my knowledge of pool equipment both old and new.</p>

							<p>With Scoville Pool Services you wonâ€™t ever have to worry about your pool being serviced by an employee. Lauren and I are a two person team here to take care of all your pool needs. Contact us for anything from a pool inspection to diagnosing any issues that you are having with your pool.</p>

							<p>We look forward to servicing your pool!</p>
